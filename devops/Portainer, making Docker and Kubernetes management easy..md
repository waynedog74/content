Portainer CE is a lightweight ‘universal’ management GUI that can be used to easily manage Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes and ACI environments. It is designed to be as simple to deploy as it is to use.

Portainer consists of a single container that can run on any cluster. It can be deployed as a Linux container or a Windows native container.

Portainer allows you to manage all your orchestrator resources (containers, images, volumes, networks and more) through a super-simple graphical interface.
