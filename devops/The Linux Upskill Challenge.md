A compact and previously paid course is now free and open source. It teaches everything someone needs in order to transition to Linux.

The range of subjects covered includes a treat for everyone;from setting up your own lab on a VPS and accessing it, to installing software, exploring the file structure, working with the CLI and its commands, to more advanced subjects like scripting.
