Lagrange is the by far best graphical web browser for the Gemini "space" (A purely text-based web equivalent for hackers). The latest release is mostly a bug-fix for the big 1.3.0 release on March 31st. It fixes a crash for those upgrading from v1.2 caused by older now invalid CA configuration, pixel ratio detection has been improved and there's a handful of other fixes relating to the sidebar, bookmarks, the Gopher URL support and keybindings.
