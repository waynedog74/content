**Apache Spark™** is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing.

**Speed:** Run programs up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10x faster on disk.

**Ease of Use:** Write applications quickly in Java, Scala, Python, R.

**Generality:** Combine SQL, streaming, and complex analytics.

**Runs Everywhere:** Spark runs on Hadoop, Mesos, standalone, or in the cloud. It can access diverse data sources including HDFS, Cassandra, HBase, and S3.
